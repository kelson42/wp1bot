Goals to finish before promoting to beta version:

* Fix all three CGI programs not to use SCRIPT_URI which is broken.
  Put all three links into the conf file and read them from there, 
  so that no links are created by hand.

* Make all theee CGI programs link to each other in the top header
  bar and in the light blue project bar

* Look through cgi-bin for duplicate code, move to a shared location

* Clean up all code, move hardcoded strings to conf file

* Move all the get_link_from_api routines to api_routines.pl?

* Put license statements in the file headers (GPL v2?)
