Goals to finish before promoting to beta version:

* Allow pages in any namespace to be rated (add ns column to ratings table
  and use it in list2.pl)

* Clean up all code, move hardcoded strings to conf file

* Look through cgi-bin for duplicate code, move to a shared location

* Switch download.pl and friends to use only utf-8 encoded data.
  So data coming out of the API has to be re-encoded within in api_routines.pl
  But then downlaod.pl and database_routines.pl will have no mention of encoding
