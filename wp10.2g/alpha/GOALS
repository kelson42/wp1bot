Goals to finish before promoting to beta version:

* Clean up all code, move hardcoded strings to conf file

* Look through cgi-bin for duplicate code, move to a shared location

* Detect when articles have been renamed, and log this appropriately
  rather than claiming the old name was removed and the new name was
  added.

* Move all the get_link_from_api routines to api_routines.pl?

* Put license statements in the file headers (GPL v2?)
