Goals to finish before promoting to beta version:

* Download and use lists of WP 0.5 and 0.7, FA, and GA articles
** FAs/GAs downloaded, now only need to be used
** Need to download WP 0.5 as well

* Allow pages in any namespace to be rated (add ns column to ratings table
  and use it in list2.pl)

* Make logs.pl as CGI script to query logs. Link to it from list2.pl.
  Should be able to list logs by project and by article. Link to 
  project logs from table.pl

* Generate some sort of index file (similar to [[WP:1.0/I]]) but online
  (maybe the bot-readable form can be the wikitext to [[WP:1.0/I]])
** Add a "type" field for sorting projects, similar to WP 0.5 ? 
** index.pl added, very simple list. Maybe we can break it up by
   first letter of shortname, or something like that. 
** Add progress bars to keep track of % of articles that are assessed,
   similar to 

    http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projet:Wikip√©dia_1.0#Projets

   This will need another column in the projects table.
  
* Figure out how to load-balance the script wrt WikiProject Biography

* Do a full bot run to make sure nothing breaks horribly

* Look through cgi-bin for duplicate code, move to a shared location

* Fix timestamp truncation errors (all over the place)
