Goals to finish before promoting to beta version:

* Change list2.pl to allow the user to specify the sort order of the
  results (by project, title, quality, importance, etc)

* Download and use lists of WP 0.5 and 0.7, FA, and GA articles
** FAs/GAs downloaded, now only need to be used
** Need to download WP 0.5 as well

* Allow pages in any namespace to be rated (add ns column to ratings table
  and use it in list2.pl)

* Make logs.pl as CGI script to query logs. Link to it from list2.pl.
  Should be able to list logs by project and by article. Link to 
  project logs from table.pl

* Generate some sort of index file (similar to [[WP:1.0/I]]) but online
  (maybe the bot-readable form can be the wikitext to [[WP:1.0/I]])
** Add a "type" field for sorting projects, similar to WP 0.5 ? 
  
* Figure out how to load-balance the script wrt WikiProject Biography

* Do a full bot run to make sure nothing breaks horribly

* Look through cgi-bin for duplicate code, move to a shared location

* Fix timestamp truncation errors (all over the place)
