Goals to finish before promoting to beta version:

* Allow pages in any namespace to be rated (add ns column to ratings table
  and use it in list2.pl)

* Figure out how to load-balance the script wrt WikiProject Biography

** Add "read from file" functionality to download.pl (to exclude Bio and
   daughter projects from one instance of the bot, and run another
   thread only for them)

* Clean up all code, move hardcoded strings to conf file

* Do a full bot run to make sure nothing breaks horribly

* Look through cgi-bin for duplicate code, move to a shared location
