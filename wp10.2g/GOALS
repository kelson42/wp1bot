The 2g system has been running live for some time.

The main lingering issues are:

1.  Write a harness for the update system so that it can queue up 
    requests for updating individual projects. This will give 
    finer-grained control to the update system, so that
 
  ** A web system can track the queue of which projects have been 
     updated, and when.  A web tool could track the queue of which
     projects will be updated soon. 

  ** Projects can request an update which will move to the top of the 
     queue subject to scheduling. This would be done with a new web 
     tool.

  ** Logs for the updates can be kept per-project, so that it is 
     possible for someone without shell access to view the logs
  
2.  In the longer term, the project may move to Wikimedia Labs. This is
    still very murky, because Labs is just being started and is not
    very well defined as of November 2012.
