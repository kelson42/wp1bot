This is a set of programs to track assessment information for articles
on Wikipedia.  This information is used to track article quality,
to prioritize work, to prioritize work within WikiProjects, and to select 
articles for release versions of Wikipedia.

There are two general components: a back end for fetching article data from
the wiki, and a front end for displaying this data dynamically over CGI.

== Configuration ==

All configuration data is read from ~/.wp10.conf . An example
configuration is provided in example.wp10.conf.

== Back end ==

The primary interface to the backend is download.pl. 

The assessment data is stored in a mysql database whose schema is in 
tables.sql.

== Front end (CGI) ==

The front end consists of an interconnected set of CGI scripts:

* index.pl : display an index of all tracked projects

* list2.pl : create and filters lists of assessed articles

* log.pl : track logs of assessment changes

* table.pl : make summary tables of article assessments by project

* table2.pl : make a global summary table

* manualselection.pl : maintain a list of articles that should be 
   included in release versions even if they do not meet the numeric 
   criteria.

* selection.pl : create lists of articles for release versions (UNWRITTEN)
