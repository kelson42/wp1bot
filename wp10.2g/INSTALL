PREREQUISITES

(1) Create counts.lst.gz using the selection tools

(2) Set up a database for the system and a working .my.cnf

(3) Set up a .wp10.cnf file in $HOME

(4) Use parse_logs.pl to download assessment logs from the wiki.
    It speeds up things later if you sort/uniq the logs.

(5) Perl dependencies include XML::Simple and Mediawiki::API

INSTALLATION

(1) Go to the backend/ directory

(2) Use tables.sql to set up the database

(3) Import counts.lst.gz using selectiondata.pl

(4) Import the old logs using insert_logs.pl

(5) Download the project data with download.pl --all

(6) Download the release with download.pl --releases

(7) Download the review data with download.pl --review

This will leave things in a functional state, but the logs
will probably need some trimming of duplicate entries
