This is a preliminary release of the SelectionBot code for version 0.7.

The steps to use the system are: 

1. Create the necessary working directories:

	sh prepareDirs.sh

You can later run 

	prepareDirs.sh clean 

to restore everything to a pristine state, deleting all created data.

2. Make the input databases, following README.Database.

3. Generate the CSV files with 

	perl makeRatingsCSV.pl

The file ProjectWhitelist can be used to filter out only a subset of the 
projects. It can be enabled by editing near the top of makeRatingsCSV.pl

4. Generate the HTML files with

	perl makeHTMLfromCSV.pl
