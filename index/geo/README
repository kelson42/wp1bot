This directory has the files for the geographical index. 

To make the pages run MakeCountries.pl. 
This reads:
  * Countries to get a list of countries
  * Matched.cats for a list of which cat3egories match which countries
  * Categories for a list of which selected articles are in which 
      categories
  * Selected.txt for the list of selected articles
  * Manual.arts.txt for the list of manually-selected articles
  * Manual.ArtsToCat.txt for some article-specifc assignments of
       WP 1.0 categories, so that no article is without

It writes to ./output/

To make the header template run MakeHeader.pl
This read:
 * Header.raw to get instructions on how to make the header
It writes to ./output/Header

I use the file 'upload.pl' to upload the files, but this requires
my perl modules to be set up.
