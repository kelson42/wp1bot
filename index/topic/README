This directory has the files for the topic index.

To make the index pages, run makePages.pl
This reads:
  * SortKeys.txt for the article sortkeys
  * Selected.txt for the main selection
  * Manual.arts.txt for info about the manually selected articles
  * Pages for the info on how to make the index pages
It writes files in ./output.

To make the header template, run makeHeader.pl
It read:
 * Header for the instructions on how to make the template
It writes: ./output/Header

The script 'upload.pl' is what I use to upload the files. But it
requires my perl library that you probably don't have.
